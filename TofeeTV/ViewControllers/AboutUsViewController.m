Founders Talea Zafar and Rabia Garib started ToffeeTV as a resource for schools and parents around the world as a fun learning tool to learn concepts and languages. Song videos and quizzes will continuously be updated.\n\nThis app, Singalong with ToffeeTV, is a resource to learn through songs. While the app is free, the paid version is a monthly subscription that allows you to download the videos and use the app without ads.\n\nWe would love to hear from you - tell us what we can do better or how you use our songs in your school or home. Stay connected with us through our website at toffeetv.com and through social media!";
